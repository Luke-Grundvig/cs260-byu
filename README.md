# Western Showdown Click

Given the choice to compete between either the fastest player or outlaws of varying skill players will go face to face with their opponent and after a randomized short wait will be told to fire. First to shoot wins and lives to face another opponent. Fastest player and most consecutive victories will be kept track of.
