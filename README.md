# Western Showdown Click
## Description Deliverable
### Elevator Pitch
A web based throwback game to an old western showdown! Instead of the quickest shot in the west, players will compete to become the fastest clicker. Given the choice to compete between either the fastest player or outlaws of varying skill players will go face to face with their opponent and after a randomized short wait will be told to fire. First to shoot wins and lives to face another opponent. Fastest player and most consecutive victories will be kept track of.
